Guitar amp simulation through Machine Learning

As guitarists, it can be a pain to find the right tone. This project explores how regeression models can be used to emulate 
the desired tone by feeding the model both with a dry signal and a wet signal (the target tone).

The idea can be further extended by using sequence to sequence machine translation using Recurrent Neural Networks.
